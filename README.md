# Spatial Econometrics - Analyzing Cost of Living Differentials

This repository contains code that performs a comprehensive analysis of the cost of living differentials across metropolitan regions in selected Brazilian capitals compared to Recife, the capital of Pernambuco state.

## Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to investigate and quantify the variations in the cost of living across different metropolitan regions using econometric methodologies, particularly employing linear regression techniques via the ordinary least squares (OLS) method.

## Methodology
The core methodology revolves around implementing the Hedonic Pricing Model, a widely recognized model in Regional Economics. This model aids in understanding the factors contributing to variations in the cost of living and enables the assessment of these variations across different geographic areas.

## Overview
The code provided here conducts a thorough examination of the cost of living differentials, leveraging spatial econometrics techniques. It serves as a practical demonstration of applying econometric models to assess regional disparities in living costs within the Brazilian context.

## Data Source
The analysis utilizes publicly available data sources, which may include economic, demographic, and housing-related datasets specific to the selected metropolitan areas. Due credit and sources will be cited or linked within the code documentation.

Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt the code to suit your specific research or extend the analysis to other regions or datasets.
